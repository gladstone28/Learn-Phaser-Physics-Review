### Learn Phaser: Physics

# Review

Great job using Phaserâ€™s Arcade physics plugin to make an entire game!

In this exercise we covered:

- Creating sprites that are affected by physics.
- Creating groups of sprites affected by physics.
- Creating groups of sprites NOT affected by physics.
- Adding Colliders objects between sprites and groups of sprites.
- Creating a loop to continuously execute a function.
- Pausing physics.
- Restarting a Scene.

See what else you can do!

### Instructions

If you want to challenge yourself:

- Change the delay property of bugGenLoop to make the game more difficult.
- Compare the difference between this.physics.add.overlap() and this.physics.add.collider()
- Check for Spacebar input and make the player sprite do something.
- Implement a High Score system.
